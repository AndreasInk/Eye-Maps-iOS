# Eye Maps

This app is designed to place 3D audio in the world for blind people to more easily navigate, especially in unfamilar places such as a new restaurant.  Eye Maps will always be open sourced and free forever.  If you'd like to help out feel free to messaage or email me at andreasink17@gmail.com and I'll be making a discord or slack soon :)
